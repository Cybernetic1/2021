The family of all symmetric functions.  The family of sum of functions.  All symmetric functions can be represented as a function composed with a sum of functions.

Cayley's theorem:  Any group can be represented as a sub-group of a special group, namely the permutation group.

Any symmetric function can be represented as a sub-function of a special symmetric function, namely the sum.

A symmetric functions in $n$ arguments as a category?  A symmetric function is a map $f: X_n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ satisfying $f (\sigma x) = f(x)$.  Or perhaps as a group $G$ such that $f(g \cdot x) = f(x)$.  It's a sheaf of functions over the symmetric group $G$.  Perhaps identify with the equivalence class of functions invariant under $G$?

Functions invariant under $G$ can be represented sub-functions of special invariant functions under $G$, namely sum.

Or the category of equivariant functions which is a group...?

A symmetric function is a category with morphisms that are group elements $g \in G$.  All symmetric functions can be represented as sub-functions of a special symmetric function, namely sum.

Yoneda embedding:  $F \hookrightarrow (F^{\mathrm{op}} \rightarrow \mathbf{Set})$ is the right G-set G.

Proof:  Regard a group $G$ as a one-object category $BG$.  The object in the image of the covariant Yoneda embedding $BG \hookrightarrow \mathbf{Set}^{BG^{\mathrm{op}}}$ is the right $G$-set $G$, with $G$ acting by right multiplication.   The only $G$-equivariant endomorphisms of the right $G$-set $G$ are those maps defined by left multiplication with a fixed element of $G$.  In particular, any $G$-equivariant endomorphism of $G$ must be an automorphism, a fact that is not otherwise obvious.

In this way, the Yoneda embedding defines an isomorphism between $G$ and the automorphism group in the right $G$-set $G$, an object in $\mathbf{Set}^{BG^{\mathrm{op}}}$.  Composing with the faithful forgetful functor $\mathbf{Set}^{BG^{\mathrm{op}}} \rightarrow \mathbf{Set}$, we obtain an isomorphism between $G$ and a subgroup of the automorphism group $\mathrm{Sym}(G)$ of the set $G$.  $\blacksquare$

Define a category of symmetric functions $\hat{\mathcal{F}}$.  What are morphisms in this category?  Probably an inner product?  Or composition of functions?

A functor $\mathcal{F} \rightarrow \mathbf{Set} = \mathcal{F}(F, -)$.  The set of $F$ composed with other functions.  

$H_F$ would be some functions composed with $F$.  $X$ would be some other functor from $\mathcal{F} \rightarrow \mathbf{Set}$.  $X(F)$ would be the functor $X$ acting on $F$ which is the composition of some function with $F$.
